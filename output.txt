Defn: The act of giving possession of a copyhold estate. Bouvier.

Syn.
 -- Admission; access; entrance; initiation.
 -- Admittance, Admission. These words are, to some extent, in a
state of transition and change. Admittance is now chiefly confined to
its primary sense of access into some locality or building. Thus we
see on the doors of factories, shops, etc. "No admittance." Its
secondary or moral sense, as "admittance to the church," is almost
entirely laid aside. Admission has taken to itself the secondary or
figurative senses; as, admission to the rights of citizenship;
admission to the church; the admissions made by one of the parties in
a dispute. And even when used in its primary sense, it is not
identical with admittance. Thus, we speak of admission into a
country, territory, and other larger localities, etc., where
admittance could not be used. So, when we speak of admission to a
concert or other public assembly, the meaning is not perhaps exactly
that of admittance, viz., access within the walls of the building,
but rather a reception into the audience, or access to the
performances. But the lines of distinction on this subject are one
definitely drawn.

government, and, in a republic, we generally speak of allegiance to
the government, to the state, etc. In well conducted monarchies,
loyalty is a warm-hearted feeling of fidelity and obedience to the
sovereign. It is personal in its nature; and hence we speak of the
loyalty of a wife to her husband, not of her allegiance. In cases
where we personify, loyalty is more commonly the word used; as,
loyalty to the constitution; loyalty to the cause of virtue; loyalty
to truth and religion, etc.
Hear me, recreant, on thine allegiance hear me! Shak.
So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found, . . . Unshaken,
unseduced, unterrified, His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.
Milton.

gloom, he was sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many
difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In like

he, because he was then considered as one of the angels. But when the

Defn: Having a disposition to do good; possessing or manifesting love
to mankind, and a desire to promote their prosperity and happiness;
disposed to give to good objects; kind; charitable.
 -- Be*nev"o*lent*ly, adv.

Syn.
 -- Benevolent, Beneficent. Etymologically considered, benevolent
implies wishing well to others, and beneficent, doing well. But by
degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only
feelings, but actions; thus, we speak of benevolent operations,
benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. In like
manner, beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we speak
of the beneficent intentions of a donor. This extension of the terms
enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. Thus, the phrase
"benevolent labors" turns attention to the source of these labors,
viz., benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark them as
productive of good. So, "beneficent intentions" point to the feelings
of the donor as bent upon some specific good act; while "benevolent
intentions" would only denote a general wish and design to do good.

 -- Burden, Load. A burden is, in the literal sense, a weight to be
borne; a load is something laid upon us to be carried. Hence, when

them cheerfully or without complaint. They may arise from the nature
of our situation; they may be allotments of Providence; they may be
the consequences of our errors. What is upon us, as a load, we
commonly carry with greater reluctance or sense of oppression. Men
often find the charge of their own families to be a burden; but if to
this be added a load of care for others, the pressure is usually
serve and irksome.

submit to sacrifices. Ordinarily, however, these words denote a
struggle arising from bad passions. In that case, strife usually
springs from a quarrelsome temper, and contention from, a selfish

train of events, something on which it truly depends. A result is
still more remote and variable, like the rebound of an elastic body
which falls in very different directions. We may foresee the effects
of a measure, may conjecture its consequences, but can rarely
discover its final results.

Syn.
 -- Handsome, Pretty. Pretty applies to things comparatively small,
which please by their delicacy and grace; as, a pretty girl, a pretty
flower, a pretty cottage. Handsome rises higher, and is applied to
objects on a larger scale. We admire what is handsome, we are pleased
with what is pretty. The word is connected with hand, and has thus
acquired the idea of training, cultivation, symmetry, and proportion,
which enters so largely into our conception of handsome. Thus Drayton
makes mention of handsome players, meaning those, who are well
trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a handsome address,
which is the result of culture; of a handsome horse or dog, which
implies well proportioned limbs; of a handsome face, to which, among
other qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful contour are
essential; of a handsome tree, and a handsome house or villa. So,
from this idea of proportion or suitableness, we have, with a
different application, the expressions, a handsome fortune, a
handsome offer.

Norman French, both implying a giving back. The word pardon, being
early used in our Bible, has, in religious matters, the same sense as
forgiveness; but in the language of common life there is a difference
between them, such as we often find between corresponding Anglo-Saxon
and Norman words. Forgive points to inward feeling, and suppose
alienated affection; when we ask forgiveness, we primarily seek the
removal of anger. Pardon looks more to outward things or
consequences, and is often applied to trifling matters, as when we
beg pardon for interrupting a man, or for jostling him in a crowd.

two words are, therefore, very clearly distinguished from each other
in most cases which relate to the common concerns of life.

and judgment; discretion; sagacity; skill; dexterity.
We speak also not in wise words of man's wisdom, but in the doctrine
of the spirit. Wyclif (1 Cor. ii. 13).
Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil
is understanding. Job xxviii. 28.
It is hoped that our rulers will act with dignity and wisdom that
they will yield everything to reason, and refuse everything to force.
Ames.

Coleridge.

2. The results of wise judgments; scientific or practical truth;
acquired knowledge; erudition.
Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty
in words and in deeds. Acts vii. 22.

Syn.
 -- Prudence; knowledge. Wisdom, Prudence, Knowledge. Wisdom has been
defined to be "the use of the best means for attaining the best
ends." "We conceive," says Whewell, " prudence as the virtue by which
we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
selection of right ends as well as of right means." Hence, wisdom
implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that
is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it
rather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures
for the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many
respects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.
Burke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into
a "reptile virtue," which is the more dangerous for its plausible
appearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
simple apprehension of facts or relations. "In strictness of
language," says Paley, " there is a difference between knowledge and
wisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it."
Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no
connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other
men; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,
unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till
smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber
whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so
much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper.
Wisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half
of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called, because appearing
comparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived
at the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1.

WISDOM LITERATURE
Wis"dom lit"er*a*ture.

Defn: The class of ancient Hebrew writings which deal reflectively
with general ethical and religious topics, as distinguished from the
prophetic and liturgical literature, and from the law. It is
comprised chiefly in the books of Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiasticus,
Ecclesiastes, and Wisdom of Solomon. The "wisdom" (Hokhmah) of these
writings consists in detached sage utterances on concrete issues of
life, without the effort at philosophical system that appeared in the
later Hellenistic reflective writing beginning with Philo Judæus.
